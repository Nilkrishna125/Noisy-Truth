# Noisy-Truth: UKF-Based State Estimation Project

## Overview

**Noisy-Truth** is a project focused on understanding and implementing the  
**Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)** for state estimation in noisy and nonlinear systems.  
The goal is to build a clear, modular, and practical filtering pipeline that can  
handle real-world uncertainty and sensor noise.

This project explores:

- How Kalman Filters work  
- Why the UKF is preferred for nonlinear systems  
- How noise, covariance, and uncertainty influence estimation  
- Implementing and testing the UKF on different models and datasets  

The repository is organized week-wise, showing the gradual development of the  
filter — starting from basic theory and moving toward full implementation.

## Project Aim

To create a robust, well-documented UKF implementation while building a strong  
understanding of the underlying concepts, noise models, and mathematical foundations.


This README serves as a high-level introduction.  
Each week has its own folder with tasks, notes, and progress.
